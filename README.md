# Loss Of Pressure

A Game Boy game developed with gbdk-2020

It's a 2d space fighting game where the player has to evade incoming enemies and shoot them while looking out for pickups for upgrades.

The .gb file should be playable with most gameboy emulators. 
Also works on original hardware either with a flashcart or by reflashing a reproduction cartridge. 
For flashing cartridges, GBxCart RW has the widest compatability with cheap chinese stuff.
Saving is not implemented as the cartridges I used didn't have any sram.

## Compiling

Get gbdk-2020 % set GBDK_HOME variable in makefile to point to the compiler location.

Use bgb emulator to see vram contents at runtime etc.
